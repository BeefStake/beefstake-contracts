# Viva Pools Staking Contracts
Viva staking pools distribute a chosen native Vite token as a reward to users staking another chosen native Vite token. The total reward rate is fixed, and staking users earn rewards proportional to the amount they stake.

This staking contract is a modification of https://github.com/weserickson/vite-staking-pools which in turn was partly based on https://github.com/ltonetwork/uniswap-farming/blob/master/contracts/Farm.sol

Tests, interfaces, documentation in progress. Contract has not been audited by external reviewers, please use with appropriate caution.
