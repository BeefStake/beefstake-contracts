# BeefStake Staking Contracts
BeefStake staking pools distribute a chosen native Vite token as a reward to users staking another chosen native Vite token. The total reward rate is fixed, and staking users earn rewards proportional to the amount they stake.

This staking contract is a modification of https://github.com/Viva-Pools/viva-contracts.

Tests, interfaces, documentation in progress. Contract has not been audited by external reviewers, please use with appropriate caution.
